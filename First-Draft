Healthcare For All
This memo is to propose a Capitalist/Socialist method of which to bring a form of healthcare funds and possible replacement for most if not all health insurance. This concept is to bring healthcare back into the hands of the people and their doctors instead of for profit corporations and governments.

Year 1
    Government will pay for 100% of the system to jumpstart it.
        Prefered if a company started this and flipped the bill but if nobody steps up then have the Government do it.
    Everyone with a SSN gets their own fee-free HSA account
    Remove contribution limitations on HSA accounts
        Unlimited contributions
        Electronic system allowing anyone to contribute to anyone else's HSA account
            Small fee of 1-2% on contributions this fee will pay for infrastructure for the system. All fees that are not used on infrastructure and employees will be sent to the bottom 10% of accounts.
                The fee is a dynamic number based on future changes to keep the system running included expansion and upgrades.
        Small fee of 2-3% of medical purchases including 
            this fee will pay for infrastructure for the system and employees. All fees that are not used on infrastructure and employees will be sent to the bottom 10% of accounts after 6 months of the previous fiscal year.
                The fee is a dynamic number based on future changes to keep the system running included expansion and upgrades.
        People with accounts that have died.
            Balance of these people will go to the bottom 10% of accounts.
